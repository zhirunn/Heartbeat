Research on the shadow beasts stops as there is no one left, but there are still issues with the shadow beasts running rampant, remnants of Kazkaza&#x27;s expiriments. Shion spends the rest of their life trying to remove of traces of these shadow beasts and help those affected by the attacks. 

Eventually, Shion develops a serum to turn themselves back to being mostly human, but Shion still suffers from some of the quips of being mutated, in a good way, with the enhanced vision, Shion had obtainined staying with them.

Shion&#x27;s actions eventually spurs rebellion in the commonfolk in the city and in the employee&#x27;s of Equinox as well against Shion&#x27;s inhumane treatement of test subjects.

Shion is in constant combat against those trying to destroy or steal thier research making them paranoid.

Equinox Employee ( female) : We should get out of this company...I think what some of the staff are saying is true. Those...things, they came from the closed wing.

Shion: Emotions...I remember, I was doing research on shadows, on utilizing negative emotional energy in a way to benifit everyone, a way to remove the negative emotions from people while making use of those emotions.

But imagine, to have the control on the emotions of others, to pull the emotions out of others and utilize them, we can remove the negative emotions from people, and make them work optimally, imagine! No pain and agony! And we can use the negative energy however we want once we learn how to use it!

Shion: We can&#x27;t play with people emotions like that! Emotions make a person, the expression of our emotions is how we convey ourselves to each other!To take them away turns us into monsters! Yin cannot exist without yang!

Shion But... I?!

Kazkaza: Silence dear. Like I told you before I don&#x27;t have that much free time, and I can see that you won&#x27;t work for me, so It&#x27;s time for us to end this relationship. Pity, I had hoped that when I enjected the essense of the shadows into you that you would have seen things differently. Look how strong you are now. Oh well. Pity.
