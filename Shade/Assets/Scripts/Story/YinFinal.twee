(Shion slowly blinks awake, eyebrows furrowing in pain emenating from behind their eyes)

Doctor Evian: Ah, you've awoken, good, good. How do you feel? Can you hear me?

Shion: Ugh. What happened to me? Where is this? Why do my eyes hurt?

Doctor Evian: Not sure, you were brought here, and I took care of you!

Shion: What?! But, where is this? Why can't I remember how I got here, or any reason why I would be here? I was at home last time I-

Doctor Evian: Ah! Interesting! Memory issues! I didn't think-

(A loud shattering noise sounds from behind Doctor Evian)

Doctor Evian: NO!! THEY CANNOT COME HERE!

[[Shion: How rude! What is this place anyways?|Negative1]] 

[[Shion: I gotta get out of this place fast, something is very wrong here!|Positive1]]

Shion: My holophone!...but it's missing the battery, where is it?

:: Afterexiting
( As Shion exits the room a metal gate comes down, blocking the entrance of the door from being acessed again. At the same time Shions arm begins to throbb a bit.)

Shion:...Ouch...my arm..why is it hurting?

( Shion looks at their arm and notices nothing out of the ordinary aside from the slight green twinge to the skin.)

Shion: Strange...anyways...I should be able to figure out what happened, or at least get an idea if I take a look at my holophones memory??? That cannot be right! There's only one location on my holophone!

Shion spends time going through their holophone and searches in the phones settings, it notes that the phone's data was wiped 3 days ago.

Shion: Ugh, something is not right here. I'll contact support and see If I can find some way to restore the data.

[[(Contacts Equinox's Holosupport number)|Kazkazasrequest]]

:: Kazkazasrequest
Kazkaza: Hello, this is Equinox, "Advancement through Technology" is our prime principle, this is Kazkaza speaking, how may I help you?

Shion: Hello, I'm from the research department, I was wondering, is it possible to have the data on my holophone restored? It's important.

Kazkaza: Let me guess, you drank too many elements at the company dinner party, ended up with some strange person who robbed you bli-

[[Shion: No! I got into an accident, and the information on my phone is really important! I need you to fix it immediately!|NegativeShionKazkaza]]

[[Shion:  Apologies, nothing that interesting. Or so I think, I can't remember, and the information on my phone would be important on figuring out what's wrong.|PositiveShionKazkaza]]

Kazkaza: Hey, Shion, how's it going? Find those parts yet?

Shion: Yeah, I got them, something weird is going on in that warehouse, I encountered moving shadows, monsters!

Kazkaza: Oh well, who cares, just bring them back over to Equinox HQ, I really need those parts, I've already been put far behind because they were late! Bye now!~

Shion: I guess I could? Depending on what it is, if it helps you get my phones data back sooner

Kazkaza: It's nothing really, I just need you to pick up a box of parts I ordered for some repairs. I'll mark the location on your holophone's holopath.


(electronics warehouse location now unlocked)

(Access to the inside of the warehouse is unlocked)

Big Boss: One thing there kiddo! There's a seal that we were using to keep those shadow monsters outta the stock, problem is someone didn't activate the seal properly so those monsters ran all over the warehouse. Once you get in there I can't let you out until you activate the seal properly! Take a look at this picture real quick, and memorize it.

Kazkaza: HOW?! DO YOU KNOW HOW MUCH MONEY? RESEARCH WENT INTO THAT?!

Shion: Do I care? Not really, especially after what YOU did to me, incase you have forgotten.

Kazkaza: WHAT DO YOU KNOW?! I MADE YOU BETTER. YOU DIDN'T LISTEN TO ME! YOU WANTED TO HIDE YOUR RESEARCH FROM ME!

[[continue|BadShionpostboss2]]








:: EpilogueGood
After lighting their old lab on fire Kazkaza perishes in the fire, attempting to save information and research on the shadow beasts. A new CTO is placed into power a month after Kazkaza's death. The new CTO demolishes the research wing, replacing it with a wing devoted to research for the holophone.

Research on the shadow beasts stops as there is no one left, but there are still issues with the shadow beasts running rampant, remnants of Kazkaza's expiriments. Shion spends the rest of their life trying to remove of traces of these shadow beasts and help those affected by the attacks. 

Eventually, Shion develops a serum to turn themselves back to being mostly human, but Shion still suffers from some of the quips of being mutated, in a good way, with the enhanced vision, Shion had obtainined staying with them.

[[The End|TheEnd]]

:: EpilogueBad
Shion eliminates Kazkaza following the battle with the massive shadow beast, and furthers the research of the shadow beasts themselves.

Shion's research eventually makes them the new CTO of Equinox and instilling fear on the populous, mercilessly testing and enhancing the strength of the shadows using humans, and cultivating people to express strong enough emotions to give birth to strong shadow monsters.

Shion's actions eventually spurs rebellion in the commonfolk in the city and in the employee's of Equinox as well against Shion's inhumane treatement of test subjects.

Shion is in constant combat against those trying to destroy or steal thier research making them paranoid.

Eventually Shion goes insane with stress and frustration, and vanishes from Equinox. Rumors are heard of a massive shadow beast prowling the city and night attacking the unsuspecting...

( Shion sees a messy desk with numerous items and papers spread about. A glimmering object catches Shion's eye and on inspection it appears to be a small jeweled cat ornament that appears to be a paper weight)

Equinox Employee (male): Well, they are most certainely real. I can't belive managment isn't doing anything about them.They told us they are containing them and doing something about it. But people are still being attacked by them!

Kazkaza: That's right! Wow, you were much faster than I thought! But then again I should have expected as much from the person who discovered the shadows beasts.The person who gave them physical form, in a lot of ways, you are their parent.

Shion: ...Mine?

[[(continue)|ShionvsKazkazaGood2]]





:: ShionvsKazkazaGood2
Kazkaza: Aparently you still don't remember enough, interesting. Well it's easy, the strongest of emotions, regret, despair, guilt, shadows are made of these, fueled by this. A lot of the shadows here are from yourself, but they are not all yours...

Shion: Emotions...I remember, I was doing research on shadows, on utilizing negative emotional energy in a way to benifit everyone, a way to remove the negative emotions from people while making use of those emotions.

:: ShionvsKazkazaGood3
Kazkaza: Oh good, I don't have to explain everything it seems. Well then let's get down to business. Work with me again. I can't manage everything being a CTO and trying to cultivate these shadows gives me close to no free time these days.

Equinox Employee ( female) : Sorry to hear that. Well.. I guess we'll never know. But between all of you and me, I think those shadow beasts came from that wing.

Kazkaza: You had it comming, you wouldn't listen to me! And in the end isn't it fine? Your research has become much more effective now that I've taken it over, and you are much stronger now!

[[(continue)|ShionvsKazkazaBad5]]

:: ShionvsKazkazaGood4
Kazkaza: These shadows can do many things, I don't think we've discovered the full extent of their abilities yet, either. But imagine, to have the control on the emotions of others, to pull the emotions out of others and utilize them, we can remove the negative emotions from people, and make them work optimally, imagine! No pain and agony! And we can use the negative energy however we want once we learn how to use it!

Shion: We can't play with people emotions like that! Emotions make a person, the expression of our emotions is how we convey ourselves to each other!To take them away turns us into monsters! Yin cannot exist without yang!

[[(continue)|ShionvsKazkazaGood5]]

:: ShionvsKazkazaGood5
Kazkaza: Doesn't matter to me, the way I see it, we are all monsters, what I do removes the demons from ourselves and pulls them to the outside. But...you know are you not worse than myself? You are the one who discovered this method after all!

Shion But... I?!

Kazkaza: Silence dear. Like I told you before I don't have that much free time, and I can see that you won't work for me, so It's time for us to end this relationship. Pity, I had hoped that when I enjected the essense of the shadows into you that you would have seen things differently. Look how strong you are now. Oh well. Pity.

Shion: We can't judge who's life is worth living and who's is not. It was never our place, and it was never the intent of the research I did, you twisted it to your own ideals. I belived harnessing the power of human emotions and desires would be benificial somwhow, now I see how wrong I was...

Kazkaza: You say that but look at you! In the end you are a monster, you have nothing! I'm the CTO of Equinox not you! I have-
